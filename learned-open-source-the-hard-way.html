      <h1>I Learned Open Source the Hard Way</h1>
      <h2>By failing publicly</h2>
    </header>

    <p>
      A few days ago, I made a mistake — the kind that hurts your ego but upgrades your brain.
    </p>

    <p>
      I wanted to make a quick open-source contribution. The motivation was familiar:
      a merged pull request, a green square, something easy to point at.
    </p>

    <h3>The Shortcut Mindset</h3>

    <p>
      I searched GitHub for “good first issues” and found one quickly.
      The task sounded trivial: add JavaDoc-style comments to a C header file.
    </p>

    <p>Instead of asking:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What does this project do?</li>
      <li>Why does it need documentation?</li>
      <li>How does documentation work in C?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I asked a different question:</p>

    <p><strong>How fast can I finish this?</strong></p>

    <p>
      I copied the header file into an AI chatbot and asked it to generate comments.
      I didn’t review the output. I didn’t understand it.
      I didn’t even read the project README.
    </p>

    <p>I opened a pull request.</p>

    <h3>The Reality Check</h3>

    <p>
      A few hours later, the maintainer replied.
    </p>

    <p>
      Not only were the comments wrong — critical code had been removed.
      Out of roughly 700 lines.
    </p>

    <p>
      That’s not a small mistake.
      That’s a trust-breaking one.
    </p>

    <p>I apologized and said I would fix it.</p>

    <h3>Making the Same Mistake Twice</h3>

    <p>
      Instead of slowing down, I doubled down.
    </p>

    <p>
      I went back to AI. Wrote “better prompts.” Trusted the output again.
      Still didn’t review it. Still didn’t understand it.
    </p>

    <p>I opened another pull request.</p>

    <p>
      This time, the maintainer was furious — and rightfully so.
      He accused me of using AI. I admitted it.
    </p>

    <p>
      He told me not to touch his code anymore.
    </p>

    <h3>The Turning Point</h3>

    <p>
      After cooling down, I reread his comments.
    </p>

    <p>
      This wasn’t arrogance or gatekeeping.
      This was someone protecting their project, their time, and their standards.
    </p>

    <p>
      I asked for one last chance — not to look good, but to do it right.
      He gave it.
    </p>

    <h3>Doing the Actual Work</h3>

    <p>This time, I slowed down.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Read the project documentation</li>
      <li>Learned what INI files are (it was an INI parser)</li>
      <li>Understood JavaDoc vs Doxygen</li>
      <li>Learned how documentation fits into C projects</li>
      <li>Made changes incrementally</li>
      <li>Reviewed every line</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Within a few hours, I fixed the issue properly.
      I learned more than I would have from ten “easy” pull requests.
    </p>

    <h3>What This Taught Me</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>AI accelerates work only when you already care about correctness</li>
      <li>Open source is collaboration, not a résumé farm</li>
      <li>Maintainers aren’t enemies — they’re guardians</li>
      <li>Owning mistakes earns more respect than pretending competence</li>
      <li>Public failure is brutal — and incredibly educational</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      I failed. I failed again. Then I learned.
    </p>

    <p>
      That was my real first contribution.
